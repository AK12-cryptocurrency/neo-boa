Compiler
========
The ``neo-boa`` compiler is a tool for compiling Python files to the ``.avm`` format for usage in the `Neo Virtual Machine <https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm/>`_ which is used to execute contracts on the `Neo Blockchain <https://github.com/neo-project/neo/>`_

The compiler supports a subset of the Python language ( in the same way that a Boa Contstrictor is a subset of the Python snake species)
