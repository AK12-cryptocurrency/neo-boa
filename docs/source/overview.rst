Overview
========

The ``neo-boa`` compiler is a tool for compiling Python files to the ``.avm`` format for usage in the `Neo Virtual Machine <https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm/>`_ which is used to execute contracts on the `Neo Blockchain <https://github.com/neo-project/neo/>`_

The compiler supports a subset of the Python language ( in the same way that a Boa Contstrictor is a subset of the Python snake species)


What does it currently do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Compiles a subset of the Python language to the ``.avm`` format for
   use in the `Neo Virtual Machine`_
-  Works for Python 3.4 and 3.5

What will it do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Compile a larger subset of the Python language
-  Support Python 3.6
